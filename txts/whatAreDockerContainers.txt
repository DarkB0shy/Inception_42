                                      WHAT IS DOCKER-CONTAINER

What "docker" does is it separates application from infrastructure. A container packages up code and dependencies so that
applications can run quickly even on different environments (OSs) through docker. It is a standardized software that contains
both the code and the dependencies needed to run the application.

A docker weighs less than a VBox: virtual machines virtualize an entire machine, down to the hardware layers; dockers
only virtualize the software layers on top of the already initialized hardware one.

Docker compose is nothing but a way to develop multi containers applications faster, it is managed through a YAML file.

Setup a Linux machine to use dockers:

  $sudo apt install -y git docker docker.io docker-compose
  $sudo service docker restart

TechWorld with Nana~Docker Volumes explained in 6 minutes

Data volumes are used for data persistency within dockers.
The container that runs on an host has a virtual filesystem where its data is stored, however if the container is stopped and
restarted that data is lost. So docker volumes are directories that get mounted into the container filesystem at runtime to ensure
data is persistent.

There are 3 types of Docker volumes:
  Host Volumes
    $docker run -v /home/mount/data:/var/lib/mysql/data (mounts local data into the container application)
    You can decide in which folder the volume is mounted into the filesystem.
  Anonymous volumes
    $docker run -v /var/lib/mysql/data
    You don't decide the location of the volume
  Named Volumes
    $docker run -v name:/var/lib/mysql/data
    You can reference that volume just by name without having to know the absolute path (within docker)
    To create a named docker volume run: $docker volume create new_named_volume

It is also possible to create volumes within the docker-compose.yml file. They must be defined under the "volumes" keyword.
